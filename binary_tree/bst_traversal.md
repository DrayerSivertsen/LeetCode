Binary Search Trees (BSTs) can be traversed in several ways, and the choice of traversal method depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand. The three main types of BST traversals are:

In-Order Traversal:

In-order traversal visits the nodes in ascending order of their values.
The order of traversal is: left subtree, current node, right subtree.
In a BST, this traversal yields nodes in sorted order.
It's commonly used to retrieve elements from a BST in sorted order.

```
def in_order_traversal(node):
    if node:
        in_order_traversal(node.left)
        print(node.value)
        in_order_traversal(node.right)
```
Pre-Order Traversal:

Pre-order traversal visits the current node before its child nodes.
The order of traversal is: current node, left subtree, right subtree.
Pre-order traversal is often used to create a deep copy of the tree or evaluate expressions.

```
def pre_order_traversal(node):
    if node:
        print(node.value)
        pre_order_traversal(node.left)
        pre_order_traversal(node.right)
```
Post-Order Traversal:

Post-order traversal visits the current node after its child nodes.
The order of traversal is: left subtree, right subtree, current node.
Post-order traversal is useful for tasks like deleting nodes, as it ensures that child nodes are processed before their parents.

```
def post_order_traversal(node):
    if node:
        post_order_traversal(node.left)
        post_order_traversal(node.right)
        print(node.value)
```
Level-Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search):

Level-order traversal visits the nodes level by level, from left to right.
It uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes at each level.
Level-order traversal is useful for tasks like finding the minimum depth of a tree or printing the tree level by level.

```
def level_order_traversal(root):
    if not root:
        return

    queue = [root]
    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        print(current.value)

        if current.left:
            queue.append(current.left)
        if current.right:
            queue.append(current.right)
```
These traversals cover different scenarios and are fundamental in understanding and manipulating binary search trees. Each traversal has its own specific use cases based on the order in which nodes are visited.
