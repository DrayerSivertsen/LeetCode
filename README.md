# LeetCode

Documenting the solutions I would like to remember for leetcode questions I have solved. 

LeetCode Account: https://leetcode.com/DrayerSivertsen/

For day to day practice I typically follow the study pattern:
1. First attempt at the problem (no more than 30min)
2. Watch NeetCode of Solution (or solutions tab)
3. Record solution in Github (sometime document in knowledge share)
4. Second attempt (on the following day)
